# Predictive Maintenance in Aviation: Leveraging Machine Learning for Time-To-Failure Prediction and Failure Classification
1. Introduction
Preventive maintenance is routine and timely maintenance of any equipment or asset to ensure
an increased period of utilization, thereby preventing any expensive and unplanned failure.
Industries employ various preventive maintenance strategies. This includes timely servicing,
maintenance and change of parts before their lifespan. However, in certain industries like aviation
and defence, where stakes are high, keeping to regular and scheduled maintenance activities
may not be very helpful and cost-effective. Hence, there is a requirement of employing statistical
data analysis and machine learning methods to build a reliable model that can assist in preventive
maintenance and enhance the sans-error operational period.
Various regression and classification techniques are used to assist in preventive maintenance.
These techniques are compared based on certain parameters and the best performing algorithm
can be used to predict the time to failure of the equipment and classify those equipment that are
likely to fail early. The same is covered in subsequent paragraphs.

2. Problem Definition
Several industries, OEMs and aircraft manufacturers intend to carry out a timely prediction of
component failures during the operation so that they can plan the required maintenance and
minimize the losses due to the time aircraft has spent on the ground.
The current health of the engine can be analysed by the data collected from the sensors and
telemetry from engine sub-systems. This data is used to predict Time-To-Failure (TTF) or
Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for aircraft components, thereby assisting in the preventive
maintenance of aircrafts. Based on the measurements from the sensors of the aircraft engine,
the developed analysis framework should provide the following predictions, which are the
objectives of this assignment:
1. Time-To-Failure (TTF) prediction for the engine
2. Classify which engine will fail in the analysed time period
